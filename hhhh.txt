Now we are going to explain our project ok lets go to the video



compinents required for the writing machine:  
          1) 2pcs of stepper motor and is used for accurate positioning with a motor,robotics, antennas, telescopes etc..
                 
         
          2) Arduino uno r3 is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P . It has 14 digital input/output pins , 6 analog inputs, a USB connection, a power jack and a reset button.


          3) Expansion board A4988 is a driver expansion board, can be used for working machines and 3D printers. It has four slots and can drive four stepper motor
     
          4) MG995 Metal Gear Servo Motor is a high-speed standard servo can rotate approximately 180 degrees. it receives and process PWM signal faster.
